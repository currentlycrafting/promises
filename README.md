# Promise

## Overview
Promise Tracker is a commitment accountability platform that enables users to make, track, and complete promises to themselves, others, or the world. The system social accountability mechanisms to help users achieve their goals.

---

## Core Concepts

### Promise Types

#### 1. **Promise to Self**
- **Definition**: Personal commitments visible only to the user (unless made public)
- **Completion**: Self-validated with optional broadcast to public feed
- **Notifications**: App-driven reminders as deadline approaches
- **Privacy**: Can be private or public. If private the global live feed will say Annoymous created a promise otherwise it'll be Salman created a promise to Khalid
- **Example**: "Salman will exercise 3 times per week for the next month"

#### 2. **Promise to Others**
- **Definition**: Commitments made to specific individuals (2-way, 3-way, or N-way)
- **Completion Requirements**:
  - **2-way**: Both creator and participant must accept completion
  - **3-way**: All three parties must accept
- **Notifications**: All participants notified + app reminders
- **Privacy**: Can be private or public. If private the global live feed will say Annoymous created a promise otherwise it'll be Salman created a promise to Khalid
- **Example**: "I will complete the project report with John and Sarah by Friday"

#### 3. **Promise to World**
- **Definition**: Public commitments to the global community
- **Completion**: Self-validated with automatic goal progression
- **Auto-Escalation**: Upon completion, system suggests a larger/more ambitious promise
- **Notifications**: App-driven + public broadcast
- **Privacy**: Can be private or public. If private the global live main feed will say Annoymous created a promise otherwise it'll be Salman created a promise to Khalid
- **Example**: "Salman will donate $1000 to charity this year"

## Key Features

### 1. Promise Creation
**Fields Required**:
- Promise content (text)
- Promise type (self/others/world)
- Deadline/timeline
- Privacy setting (public/private)
- Participants (for "others" type)

**Validation**:
- Must have at least one participant for "others" type
- Deadline must be in the future
- Maximum revision limit set at creation (default: 3)

### 2. Multi-Party Acceptance System

#### 2-Way & 3-Way Promises
```
Completion Flow:
1. Creator marks promise as complete
2. System notifies all participants
3. Each participant votes YES/NO with optional note
4. Status updates based on unanimous agreement:
   - All YES → Promise marked COMPLETED
   - Any NO → Promise remains PENDING with feedback
   - Participants can discuss and re-vote
```

### 3. Live Feed System

#### Global Feed (Main Page)
**Displays**:
- All public "world" promises (real-time)
- Completed public promises (any type)
- Milestone achievements
- Anonymous user statistics

**Feed Entry Types**:
```
- CREATED: "Anonymous user committed to running a marathon"
- COMPLETED: "Khalid completed their 30-day meditation challenge"
- REVISED: "Khalid's promise was refined after missing deadline"
- MILESTONE: "Anonymous user reached 50% of their goal"
- TERMINATED: "Anonymous user promise was terminated after 5 revision attempts"
```

**Filtering Options**:
- By promise type
- By completion status
- By time period
- By category
- Most engaging promises

#### Personal Feed
- User's own promises
- Promises they're participating in
- Private promises (visible only to user)
- Revision history

### 4. AI-Powered Promise Reframing

#### Trigger Event
When a promise is marked as "MISSED" (deadline passed without completion)

#### Reframing Flow
```
Step 1: WHY Analysis
├─ System asks: "Why did you miss this promise?"
├─ User provides detailed explanation
└─ LLM processes response

Step 2: Categorization
├─ LLM analyzes user's reason
├─ Categorizes into failure type:
│   ├─ TIME_CONSTRAINT: "Not enough time"
│   ├─ RESOURCE_LIMITATION: "Lacked money/tools/support"
│   ├─ EXTERNAL_FACTORS: "Unexpected events"
│   ├─ MOTIVATION_LOSS: "Lost interest/drive"
│   ├─ UNCLEAR_GOALS: "Goal was too vague"
│   ├─ OVERCOMMITMENT: "Took on too much"
│   └─ SKILL_GAP: "Lacked necessary skills"
└─ Category stored for analytics

Step 3: Solution Generation
├─ System uses category-specific prompts
├─ LLM generates 3 distinct solutions:
│   ├─ Solution 1: Conservative (smaller scope)
│   ├─ Solution 2: Moderate (adjusted timeline/resources)
│   └─ Solution 3: Creative (alternative approach)
└─ Each solution includes:
    ├─ Revised promise text
    ├─ New deadline
    ├─ Why this approach works
    └─ Specific actionable steps

Step 4: Selection & Update
├─ User reviews all 3 solutions
├─ Selects one (or combines elements)
├─ New promise created (linked to original)
├─ Revision count incremented
└─ Participants notified (if applicable)
```

#### Example Reframing Session
```
Original Promise: "Salman will learn Spanish fluently in 3 months"
Missed: Yes (TIME_CONSTRAINT)

User's Reason: "Salman only studied 2 hours/week because of work"

LLM Category: TIME_CONSTRAINT

Generated Solutions:

Solution 1 (Conservative):
- Promise: "Salman will complete Duolingo Spanish Level 5 in 3 months"
- Rationale: Specific, measurable, requires 30 min/day
- Timeline: 90 days
- Steps: 30 min daily practice, no fluency pressure

Solution 2 (Moderate):
- Promise: "Salman will achieve B1 Spanish conversational level in 6 months"
- Rationale: Realistic timeline with work schedule
- Timeline: 180 days
- Steps: 1 hour 3x/week + weekly conversation practice

Solution 3 (Creative):
- Promise: "Salman will have 30-minute Spanish conversations monthly for 6 months"
- Rationale: Focus on practical use, less pressure
- Timeline: 6 months
- Steps: Find language partner, monthly video calls
```

### 5. Notification System

**For Promises to Self**:
```
- 7 days before deadline: "Your promise deadline is approaching"
- 1 day before deadline: "Final reminder: promise due tomorrow"
- On deadline: "Today is your promise deadline"
- 1 day after (missed): "You missed your promise. Let's reframe?"
```

**For Promises to Others**:
```
- Same as self notifications
- PLUS participant notifications:
  - When promise is created: "You've been added to a promise"
  - When user is requested for acceptance: "Khalid has added you to a promise, would you like to accept?"
  - "Salman has just accepted a promise with Khalid"
```

**For Promises to World**:
```
- Same as self notifications
- PLUS public announcements:
  - Creation: Broadcasted to main feed
  - Milestones: Public feed updates
  - Completion: Prominent main feed feature
  - Auto-escalation suggestion: "You completed X, now try Y!"
```

#### Notification Preferences
Users can customize:
- Notification frequency (in settings)
- In-app channel
- Quiet hours
- Type-specific settings

### 6. Timer & Deadline Management

#### Timer Features
```
Promise Timer Components:
├─ Countdown Display
│   ├─ Days/Hours/Minutes remaining
│   ├─ Visual progress bar
│   └─ Percentage complete
│
├─ Milestone Tracking
│   ├─ Optional sub-deadlines
│   ├─ Progress checkpoints
│   └─ Partial completion tracking
│
└─ Deadline Actions
    ├─ Auto-mark as missed if deadline passes
    ├─ Grace period option (24-48 hours)
    └─ Trigger reframing flow
```

#### Deadline Adjustment
- Participants can propose deadline extensions
- Requires acceptance from all parties (same voting rules)
- Limited to 2 extensions per promise

### 7. Revision & Termination System

#### Revision Tracking
```
Each Promise has:
- revision_count: Current number of revisions
- max_revisions_allowed: Limit (default: 3, configurable)
- original_promise_id: Link to first version
- revision_history: Chain of all versions
```

#### Termination Rules
```
A promise is terminated if:
1. revision_count >= max_revisions_allowed
2. User explicitly terminates
3. All participants vote to terminate
4. 3 consecutive missed deadlines with no reframing

Termination Flow:
├─ Promise marked as TERMINATED
├─ All participants notified
├─ Feed entry created (if public)
├─ Analytics updated
└─ Reliability score impacted
```

#### Revision Best Practices
- First revision: Free pass, learn from experience
- Second revision: Warning shown about limit
- Third+ revision: Serious intervention, consider termination

### 8. Privacy & Visibility Controls

#### Privacy Levels
```
1. PRIVATE
   - Visible only to promise creator
   - No feed entries
   - No public analytics
   - Notifications only to creator

2. PARTICIPANTS_ONLY
   - Visible to all promise participants
   - No public feed entries
   - Participants can see each other
   - Notifications to all participants

3. PUBLIC
   - Visible on global feed
   - Included in analytics
   - Anonymous or attributed (user choice)
   - Full notification suite
```

#### User Controls
- Can change privacy level before completion
- Cannot make public promise private after others engage
- Can hide personal data while keeping promise visible

### 9. Analytics & Metrics

#### Personal Analytics (User Dashboard)
```
My Promise Stats:
├─ Total Promises: 47
├─ Completed: 32 (68%)
├─ Active: 8
├─ Missed/Revised: 7 (15%)
├─ Terminated: 0
├─ Reliability Score: 82/100
├─ Average Completion Time: 21 days
└─ Streak: 14 consecutive completions
```

#### Global Analytics (Public)
```
Platform-Wide Stats:
├─ Total Promises Made: 1,234,567
├─ Promises Kept: 834,123 (67.5%)
├─ Active Users: 45,678
├─ Promises Created Today: 1,234
└─ Average Time to Completion: 28 days
```

#### Reliability Score Calculation
```
Reliability Score Formula:
= (Completed Promises × 10) 
  - (Missed Promises × 5)
  - (Terminated Promises × 15)
  + (Streak Bonus × 2)
  / Total Promises

Factors:
- Completion: +10 points each
- On-time completion: +2 bonus
- Revision needed: -2 points
- Missed deadline: -5 points
- Termination: -15 points
- Consecutive completions: +2 per streak
```
